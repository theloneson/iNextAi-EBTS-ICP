# ⚙️ Web3 Trading Dashboard + Simulator – Frontend Build

Welcome to the **frontend layer** of our Web3 trading platform — combining a modern **Dashboard interface** and an **interactive Trading Simulator** into a seamless user experience.

This repo showcases the **design, layout, and UI logic** for both key sections, built using modern frontend tech and tools like Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and Lovable/stitch.

> **Note:** This is the **Frontend only.** Smart contract logic, backend endpoints, and live trading APIs are not handled here.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To develop a **clean, scalable, and production-ready frontend** for a Web3 trading platform, incorporating:

- A **dashboard view** for portfolio, wallet, and analytics
- An **interactive simulator** for mock token swaps and trading behavior
- A futuristic, crypto-native visual style that adapts well to live data in future phases

---

## ✅ What’s Done So Far

This phase covers **both the dashboard and simulator UI**, designed to give users a complete feel of what a real platform would behave like.

### 🧱 Dashboard
- Token balances & wallet summary UI
- Modular card layout for metrics and quick actions
- Placeholder areas for real-time stats, charts, and notifications

### ⚖️ Trading Simulator
- Simulated swap interface (token A to B)
- Dynamic form inputs with responsive styling
- Space for trade preview, gas fee estimate, slippage, etc.
- Designed to connect to live data or smart contracts later

> 💡 All components are styled consistently and responsive across devices.
