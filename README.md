# `iNextAi-EBTS`

Welcome to your new `iNextAi-EBTS` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `iNextAi-EBTS`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd iNextAi-EBTS/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

# ⚙️ Web3 Trading Dashboard + Simulator – Frontend Build

Welcome to the **frontend layer** of our Web3 trading platform — combining a modern **Dashboard interface** and an **interactive Trading Simulator** into a seamless user experience.

This repo showcases the **design, layout, and UI logic** for both key sections, built using modern frontend tech and tools like Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and Lovable/stitch.

> **Note:** This is the **Frontend only.** Smart contract logic, backend endpoints, and live trading APIs are not handled here.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To develop a **clean, scalable, and production-ready frontend** for a Web3 trading platform, incorporating:

- A **dashboard view** for portfolio, wallet, and analytics
- An **interactive simulator** for mock token swaps and trading behavior
- A futuristic, crypto-native visual style that adapts well to live data in future phases

---

## ✅ What’s Done So Far

This phase covers **both the dashboard and simulator UI**, designed to give users a complete feel of what a real platform would behave like.

### 🧱 Dashboard
- Token balances & wallet summary UI
- Modular card layout for metrics and quick actions
- Placeholder areas for real-time stats, charts, and notifications

### ⚖️ Trading Simulator
- Simulated swap interface (token A to B)
- Dynamic form inputs with responsive styling
- Space for trade preview, gas fee estimate, slippage, etc.
- Designed to connect to live data or smart contracts later

> 💡 All components are styled consistently and responsive across devices.
